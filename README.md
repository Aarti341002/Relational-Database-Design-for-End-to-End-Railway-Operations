# Railway Operations Database Management System

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a structured, normalized relational database to model end-to-end railway operations, including passenger management, ticketing, train scheduling, payments, staff duties, and onboard services.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how complex, real-world operational data can be organized into a scalable and integrity-driven relational database system, minimizing redundancy while ensuring accuracy, consistency, and efficient data retrieval.

## System Design
- Identified key railway entities such as passengers, tickets, trains, routes, stations, coaches, seats, payments, staff, and vendors
- Designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to capture relationships and dependencies
- Converted the ER model into a relational schema normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Ensured referential integrity using primary and foreign key constraints

## Key Features
- Central ticket lifecycle linking passengers, trains, seat allocation, and payments
- Modular design for staff duty assignment and vendor management
- Indexing for optimized query performance
- SQL queries simulating real operational scenarios such as:
  - Passenger–ticket mapping
  - Revenue tracking
  - Staff scheduling
    

## Tools & Concepts Used
- Relational Database Design
- ER Modeling
- Normalization (up to 3NF)
- SQL (DDL, DML, Queries)
- Primary & Foreign Key Constraints

## Use Case
This project demonstrates how a well-designed relational database can serve as the backbone for large-scale service systems like railways and can be extended for future application development, analytics, or system automation.
